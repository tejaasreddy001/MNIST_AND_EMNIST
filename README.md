# Binary Alpha Digits
Convolutional Neural Networks and Transfer Learning 

In this project, we developed a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model and employed transfer learning techniques to train and evaluate its performance in recognizing binary alpha digits. 

We have used MNIST and EMNIST datasets to train our model.
